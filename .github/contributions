This will be our folder to record what everyone contributed to the group every week :)

10/7:
Adriana - researched API implementation: 
   - I found an API by asprise that can scan receipts by taking an image of the receipt (supports JPEG, PNG, PDF, TIFF files) and
     returns the information recognized as a json file.
   - Sample implementation: http://asprise.com/receipt-ocr/blog-github-java-receipt-ocr-api-library-free-example-code-open-source
     - this is for java but it should work with kotlin as well
   - Documentation: http://asprise.com/ocr/api/docs/html/receipt-ocr.html
   - I attempted to add the implementation code and xml file (for dependencies) into github but did not write
     any extra tests because there are already tests (try) to protect from exceptions (in case the file was not read, etc.).
   - We will need an image file for this implementation to work and process the image (it will need to be named imageFile)
   - Created contributions file
